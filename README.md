## Installation

### macOS (Intel & Apple Silicon)
1. Download the `.dmg` from [Releases](https://github.com/tamert/pdfova/releases).
2. **Note:** Since the app is not signed with an Apple Developer certificate, macOS might show a "Damaged" error. To fix this, run the following command in Terminal:
   ```bash
   sudo xattr -cr /Applications/Pdfova.app
   ```
3. **Homebrew (Draft):** You can use the local cask file in `dist-scripts/homebrew/`.

  sudo apt install ./pdfova_0.3.0_amd64.deb
  ```
- **Portable (.AppImage):** Download the `.AppImage` from Releases, make it executable, and run.
- **Flatpak:** Manifesto and build guide available in `dist-scripts/flatpak/`.

## Tech Stack

- **Backend:** [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/) (lopdf, image-rs).
